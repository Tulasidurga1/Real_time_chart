### HTML Structure:

- The HTML document is structured with the standard <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, and <body> elements.
- Meta Tags:

- <meta charset="UTF-8"> sets the character encoding to UTF-8 for proper text rendering.
- <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> configures the viewport to adapt the web page's layout to the device's screen width.
# Title:

- <title>Real-Time Chart</title> defines the title of the web page displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
- Chart.js Library:

- <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script> includes the Chart.js library, which allows for easy creation and manipulation of charts and graphs.
# CSS Styles:

- The provided CSS styles make the <canvas> element (used for rendering the chart) responsive, ensuring it adapts to different screen sizes.
- Chart Container:

- A <div> element acts as a container for the chart. It has inline CSS to set its width to 80% of the parent container's width and to center it horizontally.
- Inside the <div>, there's a <canvas> element with the ID "realTimeChart," which is where the real-time line chart will be displayed.
### JavaScript:

-- JavaScript code enclosed within <script> tags is responsible for configuring and updating the real-time chart.
- Canvas Rendering Context (ctx):

- The script initializes a variable ctx by getting the 2D rendering context of the <canvas> element with the ID "realTimeChart." This context is necessary for drawing the chart.
### Chart Initialization:

- A chart variable is declared to store the Chart.js chart object.
- The initial data and configuration for the chart are defined. The chart starts with empty data and specific chart configuration options.
- Chart Update Function (addData):

- A JavaScript function named addData is defined. This function generates random data points and adds them to the chart's data.
- Interval for Data Updates:

- The setInterval function is used to call the addData function at regular intervals (every 1 second in this case). This interval triggers the addition of new data points to the chart, creating a real-time effect.
- In summary, this code creates a web page with a responsive real-time line chart using the Chart.js library. The chart is initialized with initial data, and then, at regular intervals, new data points are added to simulate real-time data updates, providing a dynamic visualization of data over time. The use of JavaScript and the Chart.js library simplifies the process of creating and updating the chart.
